Professor X claims that climate change is ending because global temperatures fell this year. However, the data showing that decline was fabricated by an intern.
@
According to Professor X, climate change is stopping since temperatures decreased this year. However, the temperature data indicating a drop was falsified by an intern.
@
Professor X argues that climate change has halted because there was a decrease in global temperatures this year. However, the dataset reporting that decrease was fabricated.
@
Professor X maintains that climate change is over due to this year’s lower global temperatures. However, the figures showing that reduction were made up by an intern.

Fire requires oxygen. This room is a vacuum, meaning it contains no oxygen. Therefore, a fire cannot be started here.
@
Oxygen is necessary for combustion. This room is a vacuum, so there is no oxygen present. Therefore, starting a fire here is impossible.
@
Combustion depends on oxygen. Because this room is a vacuum, there is no oxygen inside. Therefore, a fire cannot occur in this room.
@
Fire needs oxygen to burn. Since this room is a vacuum, oxygen is absent. Therefore, no fire can be ignited here.
@
Oxygen is essential for fire. This room contains a vacuum, which means there is no oxygen available. Therefore, it is not possible to start a fire here.

The patient has a fever, so they have an infection. If they have an infection, antibiotics should be taken. However, the patient is allergic to penicillin, so penicillin should not be prescribed.
@
Since the patient is running a fever, they likely have an infection. If an infection is present, antibiotics are recommended. However, the patient has a penicillin allergy, so penicillin must not be used.
@
The presence of a fever suggests the patient has an infection. If there is an infection, antibiotics are appropriate. However, due to a penicillin allergy, penicillin should not be given.
@
Because the patient has a fever, they are presumed to have an infection. If an infection exists, antibiotic treatment is advised. However, penicillin is unsuitable because the patient is allergic to it.
@
A fever indicates the patient has an infection. If an infection is confirmed, antibiotics are required. However, since the patient cannot tolerate penicillin, that antibiotic should not be administered.
